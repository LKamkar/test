About Us

The cBioPortal is a web tool for interactive exploration of multidimensional cancer genomics data sets.The main project is named cBio Cancer Genomics Portal (http://cbioportal.org) which is an open-access resource.

This tool is widely used around the world for visualization, analysis and download of large-scale cancer genomics data sets. We deployed it inside DKFZ intranet to ease Master program data exploration.

In case a manuscript emerges from the project in which the tool has been used, please notify master-projekte@nct-heidelberg.de, who will then provide a recommendation for an adequate acknowledgment.
